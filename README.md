Are you a [Swede](https://web.archive.org/web/20210116033317/https://satwcomic.com/fanart/6087/ein-throat-infection)? Do you suffer from Danish-related discomfort while browsing the web? Fear not, for Danitis is here to save the day! This Chrome extension transforms the web by replacing the word “Danish” with the far more appropriate “Dan[itis](https://web.archive.org/web/20231225080940/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-itis#English),” restoring your peace of mind and making the world a better place.

## Disclaimer

I hold no grudges against Denmark or its people, who are *fine*. My bone of contention lies solely with their monstrous system of noises that everyone seems to insist on calling a language. This is the least I could do to help the victims.
